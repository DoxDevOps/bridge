# Bridge

Bridge is a collection of scripts that help you export various metrices of remote hosts to a central data repo.

## Why we wrote Bridge?

We manage over ~800 remote hosts running Electronic Medical Records Systems (EMRS) somewhere in Africa! Each EMRS site is independent - with some sites connected to a central hub over an intermittent VPN connection. We wrote bridge to collect EMRS version data for connected sites. And got a little bit carried away and started exporting more metrices.

## Alternatives

Depending on your environment, you can use better monitoring systems (like Prometheus).
